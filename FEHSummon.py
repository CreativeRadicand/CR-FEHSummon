# Fire Emblem Heroes Summon Count Simulator
# Given an input of the focus character colors, the type of banner, and the number of orbs
# This project aims to visualize the expected number of copies of a target character.


# V 0.1
# We want to let this program generate a circle.
# We're going to have to add the data for the content/characters.

# Here we add the data for which characters are available in which pools.
# We have those in the 5-star pool, the 4-star special pool, and finally the 3-4 star regular pool.
# We'll have one type of banner, which is a usual 3%/3%/3%/55%/36% for the 5* Focus/5*/4* Special/4*/3*


# V 0.2
# We want to let the program ask what color you want to target, by asking it an order of priority.
# After which, it will want to check whether or not the order is valid (no repeating, only 0 to 3)
# Then, given something like 300 orbs, we try to do a summoning session until orbs are gone.
# We then report the number of targets that we have.

# V 0.3
# We now have the following things to do:
# 1) Change the number of focus units. We must have one.
# 2) We can ask the kind of banner it is. There are a couple of types to consider:
#   a) Legendary Banner [8/0/0/3/55/34]
#   b) Revival Banner [4/2/0/3/52/36]
#   c) Regular Banner [3/3/0/3/55/36]
#   d) 4-star Focus Banner [3/3/3/3/52/36]
#   e) Double Special Heroes [6/0/3/3/54/34]
#   f) Legendary Hero Remix Banner [6/0/0/3/55/36] ?? we will want to double-check.
# In hindsight I think starting with this would've been better.
# For now, we ignore the requirements except for the existence of a 4-color focus.
# We just have found a problem:
#   The game is not able to determine or differentiate which ones are the real target in the case of color-sharing.
#   The solution may be that we just roll the dice when it gets the corret color, to figure out if the person got what they're looking for.

# V 0.4 - Coming soon
# The idea here is to add pity rates, and either calculate the sums and the variances, or we add a graph. This might be harder, unfortunately, but we can learn it.
